# MamaWebsite

This is the HTML code for Mama's Website!

After downloading the code and putting it in a folder, you can edit this code using Visual Studio Code.

Visual Studio Code can be downloaded here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

You can access it by right-clicking on one of the .html files and opening it using a browser such as Chrome or Safari.

As long as all the files from this repository are in the same folder together, it should all work.

Open the code in Visual Studio Code by dragging the folder with the code onto the app icon in your dock.

You will need to link your GitHub account with Visual Studio Code so you can push updates to the GitHub whenever you update the code.

When you have the GitHub repository linked, it will keep track of changes you make to files and keep a notification on the Source Control tab on the left.

Source Control is the third icon down with the three circles connected by lines. This, along with the Explorer tab at the top (with the paper icon), are the two tabs you will likely use most.

Explorer is where you will see the files pop up. Double-click them to open the code.

When editing is done, go to the Source Control tab and click Commit & Push from the dropdown arrow. This will push your code to GitHub where I will then be able to download it!
