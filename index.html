            <br>
            It is a simple but powerful statement. 
            My name is Maximilien Hein, and I am the founder and visionary behind the 8-day week. 
            I, along with my fellow New Calendarians, believe that the current calendar system has failed the people of the world, and is therefore in urgent need of reform.
            <br>
            <br>
            My revelation came at the oddest of moments. I was playing Guitar Hero: World Tour on expert mode many years ago when The Beastie Boys' "No Sleep Till Brooklyn" appeared in the set list.
            As a fan of such visionary works as this one, I promptly began my attempts at 100%-ing the tune.
            As I listened through 4 minutes of invigorating meditations on life beyond the 9-to-5, the lyric jumped out at me: "I be rocking this party 8 days a week." 
            <br>
            <br>
            I was struck. 8 days? Was it possible? There had to be a way. I too found myself without sleep, but my Brooklyn lay on the other side of intense calculation and consideration.
            I knew there had to be a way, and as the one above whom the proverbial lightbulb ignited, the responsibility fell upon me to unearth it.
            Ultimately, for my efforts I was rewarded with the truth.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have meticulously crafted a bulletproof proposal for calendar reform that promises to radically disrupt the present establishment for the betterment of all.
